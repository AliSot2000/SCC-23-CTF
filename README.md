# SCC-23-CTF
Knowledge Exchange for CTF challenge

Good Morning everyone. I hope you guys had a good nights sleep.

I was asking around yesterday which teams would be willing to cooperate on the CTF challenge and so far I've only gotten positive feedback. With a few teams being still on the fence and wanting to discuss amongst themselves.

## Levels of colaboration:   
To make those discussions easier, I have a few questions I think you guys should vote on so we can see on what and if we can colaborate.
1. Would you be willing to cooperate in a distributed effort to search the convention for the stickers and share the location of the stickers?
2. Would you be willing to cooperate in a distributed effort to search for the codes in the booths and also share what you've found with the others?
3. Would you be willing to share your knowledge in CTF i.e. analyzing .pcap files and analayzing the network with the others?
4. Would you be willing to share results of your search in the .pcap files with the others?
6. Would you be willing to shrae results of your network scans and pen tests with the others?
7.  Would you want the shared results to be kept in a git repo so we can keep track of the contributions of the teams in order for the judges to grade the mystery application or ...
8. ... would you want the shared results to be kept in a google drive so the judges can't keep track of which team made what contributions?
9. Would you agree to penalties for a team that chose to go against the cooperation? (Exclusion from the joint efforts for that team, Dissolution of the joint effort, other suggestions...)

Please make a decision within your team until the morning standup so we can discuss that afterwards.

## Possible Scenariods for a collaboration:   

### Shared Stickers only    
- We only cooperate on the sticker hunt and social engineering.
- Each team provides one or two members for the effort and all results are shared at the end.
- From then on, we work again amongst ourselves on the .pcap files and pen tests.

### Shared Stickers and Shared Methods.   
- We work on the social engineering project like in the `Shared Stickers` approach
- Additionally, we have the people knowledgeable in the field agree to answer some questions in regards to what and how to work on this challenge but the results aren't shared

### Shared Stickers, Shared Methods, Shared Results with Git    
- Same as `Shared Stickers and Methods`
- Each team puts their progress until now into a report which they hash and then submit to the git repo.
- All further results are added to the git repo so we can keep track of who contributed what.
- Additionally, we try to distribute the work accross the teams to avoid duplicated work.

### Shared Stickers, Shared Methods, Shared Results with Google Drive   
- Same as `Shared Stickers, Shared Methods, Shared Results with Git`
- Notable difference, we don't use git but Google Drive so there's not a way to keep track of the contributions of the teams.

### Shared Stickers and Shared Results with Git.   
- Same as `Shared Stickers only`
- All results from the .pcap files are shared in a git repo with report and hash like in the `Shared Stickers, Shared Methods, Shared Results with Git` approach
- Any further results are added to the git repo, as in we found the a string that's like `{username: "some-username", password:"very-secure-password"}` but we don't share how we found that and where.

### Shared Stickers and Shared Results with Google Drive
- Same as `Shared Stickers and Shared Results with Git`
- Notable difference, we use Google Drive to eliminate the knowledge of who contributed what.
