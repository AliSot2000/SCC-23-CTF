# SCC-23-CTF
Knowledge Exchange for CTF challenge

Good Morning everyone. I hope you guys had a good nights sleep.

I was asking around yesterday which teams would be willing to cooperate on the CTF challenge and so far I've only gotten positive feedback. With a few teams being still on the fence and wanting to discuss amongst themselves.

To make those discussions easier, I have a few questions I think you guys should vote on so we can see on what and if we can colaborate.
1. Would you be willing to cooperate in a distributed effort to search the convention for the stickers and share the location of the stickers?
2. Would you be willing to cooperate in a distributed effort to search for the codes in the booths and also share what you've found with the others?
3. Would you be willing to share your knowledge in CTF i.e. analyzing .pcap files and analayzing the network with the others?
4.1 Would you be willing to share results of your search in the .pcap files with the others?
4.2 Would you be willing to shrae results of your network scans and pen tests with the others?
4.3a) Would you want the shared results to be kept in a git repo so we can keep track of the contributions of the teams in order for the judges to grade the mystery application?
4.3b) Would you want the shared results to be kept in a google drive so the judges can't keep track of which team made what contributions?
5. Would you agree to penalties for a team that chose to go against the cooperation? (Exclusion from the joint efforts for that team, Dissolution of the joint effort, other suggestions...)

Please make a decision within your team until the morning standup so we can discuss that afterwards.
